# Big Text Adventure
### CSE 237 Project - Jeffrey Su, Ryan Miller, Jonathan Feehan

This is a text-based adventure game that follows the main character through a perilous journey to find a hidden treasure. The game is played purely in the command line and is entirely text. Fight monsters, acquire loot, and more, in Big Text Adventure.

## Iteration 1
### What user stories were completed this iteration?
For this iteration, we created Game, Player, and Weapon classes and worked on features within those classes. This work took up most of the user stories in this iteration. Additionally, we began to work on some of the tests (which also included 1 user story).
### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
There is a lot more detail that can be added relative to each of the classes. Additionally, we want to start breaking "chapters" of the game into user stories so that we can write out a lot of the game's content prior to development (so that we know what to program). These will encompass most of the user stories for this iteration.
### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
Everything that exists on the main branch should work. There is work being done on separate branches that is not fully developed yet and may not be functional.
### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?
First we will navigate to the correct space:
```
cd project-big-text-adventure/big-text-adventure/src
```
and then run:
```
java Game
```
