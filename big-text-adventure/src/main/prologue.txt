============================================================
You feel a warm breeze across your face as you enter the bazaar.
Looking around the market, you notice a commotion around a nearby stall. On lookers shout that there's a thief escaping with stolen merchandise. What will you do? 

A: Head towards the commotion.
B: Head in the opposite direction.

As you walk towards the scene, a man bursts out of the crowd, knocking you to the ground.
\end_path\
\path_2\
In your rush to get away, you don't notice a man running from the crowd, shoving people out of the way You're knocked to the ground.
\end_path\

Recovering from the collision, the man yells out. "Get out of my way, kid! What's your name?
(Enter your name.)
\stop\
\name\

 Choose a response: 
A: Yeah. What are you gonna do about it?
B: Nope. *You continue walking along*
C: Uh. Um. Uh. Yeah? Wait no. No I don't!
\stop\
\path\
\path_1\
The man is taken aback. "What the heck you just say!?"
\end_path\
\path_2\
The man scoffs. "You just gonna keep walkin' like that?"
\end_path\
\path_3\
The man keeps following you. "You must think I'm stupid or somethin'."
\end_path\
\path_converge\
Then, a deep scowl appears on the man's face, almost as if nothing you said mattered.
You see his fist come towards you and you wince
but before you can make sense of the pain, everything turns black.
