You and your squad arrive to the bazaar the next day.
You see the same events as the previous day, a bazaar thief running away!
"Well ain't we gonna stop the thief!?" You ask your squad.
"No, we mustn't be distracted by some food thief, let us find the culprit!"
Ignoring the thief, you and your squad walk towards the meat shop.
There, a young man stands behind the case of meat. "What can I get you folks?"
One of the squad steps up and says "We'll take a pork shoulder, 6.9 pounds"
"Nice." Says the man, as he walks back to unlock a hidden door underneath the case of meat.
"W..what did you just do?" You ask the squad member.
"That's the code to meet the meat shop owner!" He responds.
Will you go down the hidden path?
A: Don't go down the path, your squad seems suspicious.
B: Join your squad as they go down the path.

You look around nervously, everyone seems far too comfortable.
"Uh I think I'm good guys, I'm just going to go and grab a bite to eat." You say nervously.
"Hey, you can't just leave us like that! Are you a coward?" one squad member says.

"We were never the bad guys" one of them says. "But we will never allow a coward like you to be joinin' adventures as a fake!"
You feel a bit guilty that you wanted to leave, but hey...
Not everyone can be a hero, not everyone can be brave, and...
Not everyone is ready for a big text adventure.

"Sounds about right" you say as you and your squad descend down a dark set of stairs.
"Ready your weapons folks." Says one of the squad members.
Before you reach the bottom door, a mysterious ghost appears out of the wall.
"Oooooooo....Ooooooo...OOOOOOO....I am the ghost of healthy meat portions..." The ghost says ominously.
"To oooooobtain a wonderful weapon, tell me how many calories are in 100 grams of turkey!" The ghost says.
How many calories?
A: 189 calories
B: 179 calories

"Correct! You have obtained the secret Celery Sword of Serenity!" Says the ghost.
The ghost materializes a wonderful, shining green sword that smells of celery.
"This will be the ultimate weapon against the TLoD!" Says a squad member.

As your squad reaches the door, you can hear a man shouting...
"AAGGHHH WHY MUST VEGANS, VEGETARIANS, AND VEGETABLES BE SO HEALTHY!!"
"WHY CAN I NOT GROW MEAT OUT OF THE GROUND?"
"WHY IS FATTY PORK NOT AS HEALTHY AS BROCOLLI??"
You and your squad tense up and draw your weapons.
You kick down the door.
You see the same man who knocked you out standing amongst a pile of steaks, chickens, ducks, and pork chops.
His eyes filled with tears, he says..."For years I have felt wronged by veggies...now...it is time for me to take my revenge!"
He closes his eyes and begins a chant as the meat begins to swirl around his body.
"Quick! Take him out before he finishes the ritual!" Says a squad member.
But before you can attack, all of the meat drops and the man's eyes turn red.
Suddenly, a deafening explosion causes your squad to turn to dust, except you.
"BOW BEFORE ME, THE DRAGON OF MEAT!" Says the meat man, now transformed into a large dragon composed of various high quality cuts of meat.
"Never." You say, beginning to crave a nice green salad.
Imbued with energy from the greens in the market above you, you prepare to fight.

"I...just wanted to eliminate all vegetables...." The dragon says before he crumbles to bones.
...
......
"MEAT your maker, you sick fool!" you proudly proclaim.
"Pun intended."
Not everyone can be a hero, and not everyone can be brave...
But in the face of adversity and the extinction of all vegetables,
You stood your ground, and the world will be forever grateful.

"BWAHAHAHAHA, VEGETABLES WILL BE NO LONGER! GOODBYE GREEN INSECTS!"
"No....I'm sorry....vegetables..." you say as everything fades to black.
Not everyone can be a hero, and not everyone can be brave...
But you fought your hardest, even if it means no leafy greens ever again.
