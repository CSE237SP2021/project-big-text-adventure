As you walk in the bar, you overhear a couple of locals talking.
"So there I was the other week and this guy comes up to me in the bazaar and get this..."
"And then BAM!, he just socks me right in 'da face! What was that?"
"Ey! Same thing happened to me the other day while I was shoppin' for some veggies!"
"Woah no way, same dude really gave me a headache at the same place!"
"You begin to realize that they're talking about the same man who punched you."

You decide that their fight is worth fighting and take a seat at the table.
"So, where can we find this bazaar assassin?" you ask.
"We think he runs the local meat shop, there's been so many new vegans recently, and his meat shop ain't been doin' too well!" Says one of the locals.
"But why would he go around attacking random people?" You ask.
"The Turkey Leg of Destiny" the locals all say in unison.
How will you respond?
A: The what of what?
B: Turkey leg?? You mean this? *You pull out a drumstick out of your sack.

The locals look both ways and motion for a huddle so nobody can hear the conversation.
"Legend has it, if someone with the Turkey Leg of Destiny (TLoD) knocks someone out..."
"They can use the TLoD to make them hate vegetables!!" They say together.
"W..wh...what..." you say in disbelief as you realize that you have no appetite for the wonderful pot roast filled with carrots, potatoes, and onions in front of you.
"We haven't eaten veggies in a week...we feel so...frail..." one of them says.
"We must go to this meat shop and confront this fowl bazaar assassin!" You say.
"Agreed! To vegetables!" The locals chant!

"W..wh...WHERE DID YOU GET THAT!?" one of them says, taken aback.
"Wait wait, no, that's the Chicken Leg of Might!" Another says.
"What's that?" You ask
"If you consume it, it gives you THE MIGHT OF A MIGHTY CHICKEN!" They say in unison.
You take a bite while the locals stare in awe, instantly you begin to feel...
MIGHTY, FAST, AND POWERFUL!!
"But what about the Turkey Leg of Destiny?", you ask.
