You wake up in a dark alley.
'I will find you, wretched man', you whisper under your breath.
Conveniently, before you lay three weapons: a staff of magic, a sword of brutality, and a dagger of stealth.
Pick a weapon. This will decide your class.
A: Pick up the staff of magic (become a mage).
B: Pick up the sword of brutality (become a warrior).
C: Pick up the dagger of stealth (become an assassin).

You exit the alley onto a bustling street. Which way will you go?
